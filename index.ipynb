    "The following code imports several Python modules and libraries that are necessary for implementing human-centered financial summarization using the Pegasus model. Here is an explanation of each import statement:\n",
    "- **transformers**: This imports the PegasusTokenizer and PegasusForConditionalGeneration classes from the transformers library. Pegasus is a state-of-the-art pre-trained language model developed by the Hugging Face team for natural language processing tasks such as text summarization. The PegasusTokenizer class is used to convert input text into numerical tokens that can be processed by the Pegasus model, while the PegasusForConditionalGeneration class is used to generate summaries from the tokenized input text.\n",
    "- **beautifulsoup4**: This imports the BeautifulSoup class from the bs4 library. BeautifulSoup is a Python library for web scraping and parsing HTML and XML documents. It provides a simple and efficient way to extract data from web pages.\n",
    "- **requests**: This imports the requests library, which is used for sending HTTP requests to web servers and receiving responses. In this context, it is used for downloading web pages that will be used as input for summarization.\n",
    "- **selenium**: This imports the webdriver module from the selenium library. Selenium is a popular tool for automating web browsers, and it is commonly used for web scraping and testing. In this context, it is used to programmatically control a web browser and interact with web pages in order to scrape data.\n",
    "- **webdriver-manager**: This imports the ChromeDriverManager class from the webdriver_manager.chrome module. The ChromeDriverManager is a library for managing ChromeDriver executables, which are necessary for running automated tests or web scraping with Selenium.\n",
    "- **time**: This imports the time module, which provides various time-related functions. In this context, it is used to add delays in the program to give time for web pages to load and to avoid overloading web servers with too many requests.\n",
    "- **By**: This imports the By class from the selenium.webdriver.common.by module. The By class is used to specify the method of locating elements on a web page. For example, it can be used to find elements by their ID, class, name, or tag name.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **re**: This imports the re module, which provides support for regular expressions. Regular expressions are a powerful tool for manipulating and searching text data. In this context, it may be used for cleaning and preprocessing the input text before tokenization and summarization.\n"

The generate function of the model takes in the input tensor IDs and generates a summary using a beam search algorithm. The max_length argument specifies the maximum length of the summary, num_beams argument specifies the number of beams to use during beam search, and early_stopping argument specifies whether to stop the beam search early if the max_length is reached.\n",

The summary is then assigned to the summary variable for further use."

MicroStrategy reported a net loss for the fourth quarter of $249.7 million. \"Our corporate strategy and conviction in acquiring, holding, and growing our bitcoin position for the long term remains unchanged,\" said MicroStrategy CFO Andrew Kang. MicroStrategy took a $197.6 million impairment charge for the fourth quarter on its bitcoin holdings, bringing its cumulative impairment charges related to bitcoin to $2.15 billion. The company’s founder and Executive Chairman Michael Saylor has said previously that buying bitcoin has raised its public profile. Saylor stepped down in August from his role as CEO to focus on the company’s bitcoin strategy and related bitcoin advocacy initiatives. To buy bitcoin, MicroStrategy has issued corporate debt, convertible bonds, equity, and taken out a loan with some of its bitcoin. During the quarter, the company issued $46.2 million worth its stock, and as of December 31, MicroStrategy had around $450 million available for sale under its current authorizaton.

Building new and better applications is the crucial next step for attracting crypto\\'s next wave of users, Coinbase said. \"We\\'ve done a really great job doing that on trading and speculation,\" Jesse Pollak, the project lead and Coinbase\\'s senior director of engineering, told Yahoo Finance. \"But we haven\\'t seen the really useful applications emerge yet.\" The Base protocol has been built using open source software created by the Layer 2 blockchain Optimism. The company has no plans for issuing a token related to the new protocol. Within the hour following the announcement, the native token for Optimism - OP - jumped 7%. In recent weeks Coinbase opened its blockchain to 48 other crypto collabortators in DeFi, NFTs, gaming, and infrastructure, including Chainlink, Animoca Brands, Nansen, Magic Eden, Ribbon Finance, and Wormhole. Coinbase\\'s announcement comes two days after the company reported a surprise fourth quarter revenue beat and a narrower than expected loss for 2022. Wall Street\\'s reactions were mixed, however, with some analysts arguing the surprise boost was ancillary to the company\\'s core business. Shares of Coinbase spiked more than 5% at Thursday\\'s open. The stock has lost more than 60% from a year ago; still, it has nearly doubled year-to-date. Coinbase also announced the Base Ecosystem fund on Thursday, which will invest in early stage projects building on the protocol in collaboration with Coinbase Ventures. The company wouldn\\'t share the amount of capital it plans to deploy through the fund. Bitcoin, ether, and other major cryptocurrencies represent units of account for Layer 1 blockchains.

Block reports the total sale amount of bitcoin to customers as revenue. Cash App generated $35 million in bitcoin gross profit in the quarter, down 25% from the year earlier and slightly less than the $37 million reported in the third quarter. The year-over-year decline in bitcoin revenue and gross profit was driven by the fall in the price of bitcoin, Block said in its quarterly shareholder letter Thursday. For the full year of 2022, Cash App generated $7.11 billion of bitcoin revenue and $156 million of bitcoin gross profit, down 29% and 28%, respectively, from the previous year. Block recorded an impairment charge of $9 million on its bitcoin investment during the fourth quarter, compared to $2 million in the third quarter. For the full year of 2022, Block recognized a bitcoin impairment loss of $47 million. As of Dec. 31, the fair value of Block's bitcoin investment was $133 million based on “observable market prices,” which was $30 million greater than the carrying value of the investment after impairment charges, the company noted. Overall, the company reported adjusted earnings per share of 22 cents on $4.65 billion in revenue, compared to analyst estimates of EPS of 30 centsand revenue of $4.63 billion, according to FactSet.

       "  'Join the most important conversation in crypto and web3! Secure your seat today Last month, Bitcoin developer James O\\'Beirne sounded the alarm: The dominant blockchain might lose some very talented contributors if someone doesn’t step up to pay them for their work. That work involves writing and maintaining code for the Bitcoin blockchain, tasks completely dependent on grants and donations from businesses and voluntary contributors. But relying on grants, stipends and free labor makes Bitcoin development prone to the ebb and flow of crypto markets – and goodwill. This story is part of CoinDesk’s “BUIDL Week.\" The price of bitcoin (BTC) is currently down by well over 60% since its all-time high in November 2021. Consequently, many Bitcoin businesses – the main source of those grants and stipends – have tightened their purse strings and some have even been forced into bankruptcy, leaving many in the community anxious about how Bitcoin developers will get paid in the future. “It\\'d be really nice to see more Bitcoin businesses step up,” O\\'Beirne tweeted. “This could get bad.” Steven Lee, who leads Spiral, a subsidiary of Jack Dorsey’s Block that focuses on funding Bitcoin development, isn’t as pessimistic and chalks up the gloomy funding situation to the current slump in crypto asset prices. “You have to recognize that we\\'re in the middle of a bear market,” Lee told CoinDesk in an interview. “Some companies and funders that were doing a really nice job of funding developers have had to reduce that due to financial pressures and the bear market.” Adam Back, CEO and co-founder of Bitcoin infrastructure firm Blockstream, chimed in with a response to O\\'Beirne’s SOS and pointed out that the recent deluge of layoffs may have forced cash-strapped crypto exchanges to cut spending and opt out of renewing developer grants.

       "  'Join the most important conversation in crypto and web3! Secure your seat today Yes, you read the headline right. Bitcoin (BTC) futures really are, unusually, trading at a higher premium on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) than on Binance. Three-month bitcoin futures listed on CME, widely considered a proxy for institutional activity, are trading at an annualized premium of around 8.7% to the underlying reference index. The equivalent premium on offshore exchanges, mainly Binance, has jumped to 6.3%, the highest since January 2022. On CME, the premium is the highest positive basis since November 2021, according to data tracked by Arcane Research. Back then, bitcoin traded at record highs near $69,000 – almost three times the current $24,850, CoinDesk data show. (We are talking of premiums in standard futures market here, not perpetuals, which are futures-like derivatives with no expiry.) Bitcoin has surged over 45% so far this year, outperforming traditional risk assets, including Wall Street\\'s tech-heavy Nasdaq index, by a significant margin. Futures typically trade at a premium in a sign of leverage being skewed on the bullish side when the underlying asset is appreciating in value. Conversely, during bear markets, discounts are often observed. \"The bull is back,\" Arcane\\'s research analyst Vetle Lunde told CoinDesk. Historically, futures on the CME have traded at a relatively lower premium than those on Binance and other unregulated offshore entities, predominantly because these latter avenues offered higher leverage. That means traders on offshore exchanges were able to take bigger bullish bets while depositing a relatively small amount of money, called a margin. However, offshore exchanges have cut back on leverage since the second half of 2021, and they now account for just 30% of the global futures activity, while the rest comes from the CME. Another reason the CME has flipped offshore exchanges is that futures-based exchange-traded funds tied to bitcoin invest only in regulated CME futures contracts. According to Arcane Research, open interest, or the number of open futures contracts on the CME, currently sits at 80,586 BTC – or 70% of the global open interest.

Underneath the surface, retail investors continue to buy with enthusiasm, as data from VandaTrack published Thursday showed some $1.5 billion per day is coming into the market from this group. And while single-stock action remains volatile with earnings season continuing to offer fireworks — see DraftKings (DKNG) and Shopify (SHOP), which rose 13% and fell 15%, respectively, after quarterly results this week — the big market storylines continued to be dominated by one topic: the U.S. economy. The U.S. economy remains more resilient than most experts expected as a cumulative 4.5% increase in the Federal Reserve\\'s benchmark interest rate since March 2022 hasn\\'t yet choked off the labor market, consumer spending, or overall growth. This week, data on retail sales showed consumers did little holding back to start the year, with sales rising 3% in January, the biggest monthly increase since March 2021. Wednesday\\'s data came just a day after January inflation data showed price increases were firmer than expected to start the year, with the headline Consumer Price Index (CPI) rising 0.5% over last month and 6.4% over last year. \"Core\" CPI, which strips out the more volatile costs of food and gas, rose 0.4% over last month and 5.6% over last year. Taken together, these reports show both inflation pressures fading less quickly than expected and consumers appearing less sensitive to these pressures. In 2022, the conversation about the U.S. economy broke into two basic camps — hard landing and soft landing. A hard landing would see the Fed\\'s rate hikes send the economy into recession with the labor market weakening considerably. A soft landing would see rate hikes slow inflation without crashing the economy into a downturn. But now, a third way has emerged among the economic commentariat: a \"no landing.\" As Yahoo Finance\\'s Alexandra Semenova detailed on Friday, a \"no landing\" means inflation remains elevated but the economy keeps growing.

Currently changing hands at $22,910, bitcoin (BTC-USD) has been trading over the past week at its highest level since August of last year. The largest cryptocurrency hasn\\'t given holders such an uplifting January in a decade. “We started January off with some explosive price action the week of December\\'s CPI print,” said Christopher Newhouse, options trader with crypto market maker GSR. From Newhouse\\'s perspective, buyer side demand from institutional takers — whether macro driven traders or hedge funds — returned in the first two weeks of the month, which sparked initial short seller liquidations. In the 12 days following December\\'s inflation report released on Jan. 12, $1.3 billion worth of short positions on bitcoin were liquidated, or $611 million as net of long positions, according to crypto derivatives aggregator CoinGlass. Over the past week, the trend has reversed with $331 million in long positions liquidated, or $108 million net of short positions. Between January 10 and 20, which is when bitcoin saw its largest moves higher, speculation-driven momentum traders returned to the market, spearheading bitcoin breaking out from a range of between $15,700 and $18,000. \"Bitcoin’s pushes above $20,000 and $22,000 both happened on Fridays as dealers had large amounts of negative gamma exposure and forced to hedge towards the end of U.S. hours trading,\" Newhouse observed. Analysts say the next leg for bitcoin will likely be determined in the days following the Federal Reserve\\'s monthly rate hike decision. “This market is going to start to trade very technical,” Edward Moya, a senior analyst at Oanda told Yahoo Finance, \"Volatility is coming back.\" The return of bitcoin buying looks similar to what occurred from July through early August according to Michael Safai, co-founder and partner with crypto trading firm, Dexterity Capital. \"It takes about two months or so for the crypto market to stabilize after a major shock, and we’re at that point post-FTX,\" Safai said over email. \"The worst of the damage',\n",
       "  'Back in 2017, John Griffin, a professor of finance at the University of Texas McCombs School of Business, noticed something strange. Griffin follows a totally different beat from typical business school finance profs who explore, say, how business cycles influence commodity prices or Fed policy sways the term structure of interest rates. The 6-foot-2 former high school football star views himself as a crusader for good, a moral sleuth who, as he tells Fortune, “looks to expose financial evil, to shed light on the world and expose dark things in the markets.” After the Great Financial Crisis, Griffin became a devout Christian. He has since dedicated his distinguished career to righteous forensic digging that’s unearthed abuses ranging from insider trading to mortgage fraud to the doctoring of bond ratings during the financial crisis. As Griffin and Amin Shams, then a doctoral candidate at McCombs who’s joined Griffin in several gumshoe investigations, screened for misdeeds in 2017, they were fascinated to see that a little-known token that’s supposed to be backed one-for-one to the dollar was getting printed in large quantities. That clue led the pair to another: When new batches appeared, the price of Bitcoin seemed to jump. It looked like someone, or a group, was using that freshly printed “free money” to inflate Bitcoin’s price for their own profit. He and his coauthor Shams sifted through an incredible 200 gigabytes of trading data, equal to the troves that the Smithsonian Institution collects in two years, and followed sales and purchases from 2.5 million separate wallets. In 2018, they coauthored a groundbreaking study showing that a single, still unidentified, Bitcoin “whale” almost singlehandedly drove the token’s giant run-up in late 2017 and early 2018 by distorting the trading in the token. Toward the end of 2022, another mystifying trend caught Griffin’s eye. Despite the crypto crash and myriad other negative forces, every time Bitcoin briefly breached the $16,000 floor, it bounced above that level and kept stubbornly trading between $16,000 and $17,000. Almost unbelievably, as the crypto market has continued to unravel into 2023, Bitcoin has gone in the opposite',\n",

When Ethereum completed a successful network upgrade in 2022, shifting from a proof-of-work (PoW) blockchain to a proof-of-stake (PoS) network, this created an opportunity for individuals to earn blockchain rewards by running a network validator node and contributing to network security. Under the new PoS mechanism, the Ethereum network is secured by validators instead of miners, and those running a validator may earn rewards paid to them directly by the network, for their help in securing and running the network. Running a validator on Ethereum requires more technical knowledge than many cryptocurrency investors have, which led companies to offer “staking-as-a-service” products to retail traders and investors. Kraken, along with others, offered their customers the ability to stake Ethereum collectively, in a commingled staking pool, to generate staking rewards. While many investors appreciated these services, the SEC did not. Their public complaint states, “Kraken has offered and sold its crypto asset ‘staking services’ to the general public, whereby Kraken pools certain crypto assets transferred by investors and stakes them on behalf of those investors. Staking is a process in which investors lock up – or ‘stake’ – their crypto tokens with a blockchain validator with the goal\",\n",

       "  'Join the most important conversation in crypto and web3! Secure your seat today One of the most significant events for the Ethereum blockchain is likely to be the Shanghai upgrade. Currently planned for the second half of 2023, the Shanghai upgrade will implement a number of improvements to Ethereum. Chief among them is the ability for ether (ETH) stakers to withdraw both their staked coins and accrued rewards. Users have helped to validate transactions on the so-called Beacon Chain since December 2020, when the proof-of-stake network launched. But so far staking has been a one-way trip: Funds were locked in the deposit contract while Ethereum developers built out the network in real time. This article is part of CoinDesk’s “BUIDL Week.” Kevin de Patoul is the co-founder and CEO of Keyrock. Protocols such as Lido, Rocketpool and StakeWise have begun offering “liquid staking” minted tokens to fill the gap. These tokens represent staked ETH but fluctuate in price, and can be used across the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. It remains to be seen how the upcoming Shanghai upgrade – which may precede a flood of ETH tokens into the market, by enabling new and existing stakers to withdraw – will affect these protocols that dominate liquid staking today. Overall, this upcoming upgrade has the ability to increase the popularity of ETH staking. It will drive competition between staking protocols to users’ benefit, while also improving the security of Ethereum’s new PoS chain. It’s easy to think that launching Shanghai in the middle of a bear market could hurt the staking ecosystem. Stakers, skittish about the macro outlook of crypto in 2023, may choose to withdraw their ETH, keeping their assets liquid in case of more market turmoil. Cautious of regulatory movements against staking providers, new stakers may not rush to deposit funds the same as during the frenzy of a bull market. In the long run, however, Shanghai (specifically, the ability to unstake and withdraw rewards) is bullish for Ethereum. Specifically, Shanghai will increase incentives for ETH liquidity providers in three main ways. First, Shanghai will spur more innovation in',\n",

The crypto market did not respond well to the SEC\\'s attack on Kraken, as the announcement brought an end to the climb of bitcoin (BTC-USD) and ethereum since the beginning of 2023. Paxos, which partners with Binance to issue the BUSD stablecoin (BUSD-USD), has also been told by a New York regulator to halt the minting of new coins, according to a Bloomberg report. The global cryptocurrency market cap has digested the latest regulatory attacks on the industry by falling 1.6% in 24 hours to $1.05tn, according to Coingecko. Ethereum dropped 9% in the past seven days to $1,483, while bitcoin fell 6.2% to $21,537. The decent into the red began in earnest last Thursday when SEC chair Gary Gensler announced he would be charging Kraken with failing to register the offer and sale of its \"staking as a service\" program. Kraken, which is the third largest crypto-exchange in the world after Binance and Coinbase (COIN), had been offering staking services for at least half a dozen crypto tokens, including ethereum.

While much has been written about Bitcoin maximalism’s impact as a cultural force (and its inevitable decline), less has been said about how the ideology drives financial markets – including its influence on deployment decisions for institutional capital. This is worth examining because digital asset allocations may now be poised for a revolutionary shift towards the Ethereum blockchain. Bitcoin (BTC) miners, in particular, may face a new opportunity as Ethereum’s potential value is unlocked. This opportunity may help offset and reverse the pressured margins that have dominated the sector starting in 2022, and may continue for some time. Sam Tabar is chief strategist for Bit Digital, a bitcoin mining company listed on Nasdaq (BTBT). Next year, the number of bitcoins that can be mined per block will drop from 6.25 bitcoin to 3.125, making it harder for miners to turn a profit – unless, of course, the BTC price rises and/or network competition declines enough to compensate. Some believe this is exactly what will transpire, and much has been written on the Bitcoin blockchain’s supply/demand mechanism and its impact on mining economics. But from a simplistic, point-in-time perspective, at the exact moment of halvening, miner revenue will be instantly cut in half (assuming all else remains equal, admittedly a big assumption). Ethereum, at first glance, may seem like an unlikely contender to add value to bitcoin miners. The network’s recent transition to a “proof-of-stake” (PoS) model eliminates the role of mining altogether. However, a PoS model for consensus allows Ethereum validators to receive passive ether (ETH) rewards, something currently not possible with Bitcoin. The mining sector is sitting on massive bitcoin reserves that have limited use as a financial instrument, outside of converting to cash to cover operations, and holding for the long term as bitcoin’s value recovers. Ethereum’s network and its possibilities, by contrast, are always changing. Ethereum developers have fueled a proliferation of use cases, including the rise of decentralized exchanges (DEX), stablecoins and non-fungible tokens (NFT). Ethereum’s',\n",

Secure your seat today Recent regulatory initiatives have shown the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) dominant position in the U.S. in regulating the digital assets space, JPMorgan (JPM) said in a research report last week. Its actions have also shown the SEC’s bias in viewing most crypto, with maybe bitcoin (BTC) as the only exception, as securities, the report said. It noted that SEC Chair Gary Gensler started pushing back against implementing special rules for the crypto industry in September, arguing that most cryptocurrencies should be classed as securities and thus be regulated under existing securities laws. “Given the above it should not come as a surprise that the SEC looks at the offering of a staking service as being similar to offering any other type of security,” the note said. This opens the way for other firms offering staking services to have to be registered as a securities platform with the SEC, the report added. The bank predicted more regulatory actions on stablecoin issuers, custody and protection of investors’ digital assets, and on the unbundling of broker/trader/lending/clearing/custody activities. It also expects mandated regular disclosure, reporting and auditing of reserves, assets and liabilities across major crypto entities, analysts led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote. These regulations will lead to “convergence of the crypto ecosystem towards the traditional financial system over time,” he added. “Staking business should shift more towards direct staking for institutional investors and more towards decentralized (DeFi staking) alternatives for retail investors,” the note said. DeFi is an umbrella term for a variety of financial applications carried out on a blockchain. Ether (ETH) will likely see additional selling pressure on Ethereum following the forthcoming Shanghai upgrade, as crypto exchange Kraken has 1.2 million ETH staked on the network, a significant amount of which is owned by its U.S. clients.

The stores, which were launched with funds from the Solana Foundation, were meant to spread the word about the blockchain and its cryptocurrency, SOL, whose value has fallen after FTX’s implosion and subsequent bankruptcy. From August to the end of 2022, the independently owned and operated stores, dubbed “Solana Spaces,” helped facilitate some 16,000 tutorials of the network, according to the Solana Foundation, which works to build out the blockchain. “While it’s unfortunate that Spaces is sunsetting its two experimental retail locations, the Solana Foundation looks forward to the community creating other unique onboarding experiences,\" a spokesperson for the foundation said in a statement to Fortune. On a tour of the New York City store in Hudson Yards a day before it opened in July, Fortune found that people were excited by the concept. This version of the store included a display of Degenerate Ape Academy NFTs on the wall and an interactive dashboard of the real-time transactions happening on the blockchain. It also had a station to help customers create a Phantom wallet, the most popular crypto wallet for Solana. At the time, Vibhu Norby, the Solana Spaces CEO, told Fortune that the store is “an experiment that we think a lot of people will love.” The store closings come as the larger crypto market continues to struggle, with even the most popular cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, not able to maintain an extended bull run. The Solana blockchain and its token SOL have faced headwinds in particular because of close ties with Sam Bankman-Fried, the disgraced former CEO of FTX who\\'s now facing criminal charges for fraud.

       "  'Sally Walker, Britain\\'s former spy chief talks about her first boss Ukraine has been purchasing military equipment using cryptocurrencies, with the nation\\'s deputy digital minister claiming that 60% of suppliers were able to accept crypto in return for combat essentials such as \"helmets and bullet proof vests\". One year ago, Russian president Vladimir Putin began the invasion of Ukraine. Two days after the war broke out on 24 February 2022, the Ukrainian government\\'s Twitter accounts posted requests for cryptocurrency donations in bitcoin (BTC-USD), ethereum (ETH-USD) and the USDT (USDT-USD) stablecoin. As blockchains are transparent publicly distributed ledgers, it can be seen that more than 100,000 people have sent crypto to Ukraine. The country claims that some of these donations came from Russians, who have sent \"significant amounts\". On this week\\'s episode of Yahoo Finance UK\\'s The Crypto Mile, Ukrainian deputy digital minister Alex Bornyakov described cryptocurrency donations to Ukraine as varying \"from one dollars worth, to millions of dollars\". Read more: Crypto live prices He said that Ukraine turned to crypto at the start of the invasion because the nation needed help immediately. \"If we used the traditional financial system it was going to take days,\" he said. \"We were able to secure the purchase of vital items in no time at all via crypto, and what is amazing is that around 60% of suppliers were able to accept crypto, I didn\\'t expect this.\" Although his interview with The Crypto Mile via satellite internet link from his office in Ukraine was restricted by periodic power cuts, he was able to add: \"Companies manufacturing goods like bulletproof vests, helmets and different kind of optics, even they were able to receive crypto\". Alona Shevchenko, co-founder Ukraine DAO, told Yahoo Finance UK: “In the beginning of the full scale invasion a year ago, Ukraine found itself in an extremely tough situation and those first days were absolutely critical for our defence. \"The central bank introduced limits on foreign currency transfers in and out of Ukraine to stop the run on the hryvnia. \"Thanks to crypto we were able to cover some of our',\n",

WASHINGTON, Feb. 14, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Today, Sol Systems, a national solar energy company focused on developing and operating renewable energy assets with community impact, announced an additional $1.2 million in investments into community organizations focused on environmental justice, workforce training and climate resiliency. This investment builds on the initial $200,000 invested in 2022 and commits new funding to the original five partners while adding five new partners: Appalachian Voices, Virginia Environmental Justice Collaborative, Community Housing Partners, Climate Access Fund, and Rebuilding Together DC Alexandria. “At Sol we aim to build critical sustainable infrastructure for the future and also ensure that local communities benefit. We are proud to expand our collaboration and investment with these community partner organizations and Microsoft and look forward to building on this foundation moving forward,” said Yuri Horwitz, Chief Executive Officer.  “Microsoft has made commitments to environmental sustainability, diversity and inclusion, and racial equity, and an important point of intersection for these commitments is environmental justice. For us, the foundation of pursuing environmental justice is to center communities and those who have been impacted most by industrial pollution and are more vulnerable to climate change.\\xa0 We believe it is important to fund community-serving organizations like these to implement solutions with partners like Sol Systems,” said Danielle Decatur, Director of Environmental Justice, Microsoft. The total announced $1.4 million in investments is the initial phase of a partnership with Microsoft, announced in July of 2020, that combines a 500 MW framework power purchase agreement (PPA) with a strategy to invest over $50 million in communities disproportionately impacted by environmental issues. “Appalachian Voices is thrilled to partner with Sol Systems to expand the breadth of support offered by our Appalachian Solar Finance Fund (SFF) to community anchor institutions such as schools, hospitals, libraries, and fire departments in coal-impacted Central Appalachian counties.

       "  'In this article, we will take a look at the 12 most promising tech stocks according to analysts. To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Most Promising Tech Stocks According to Analysts. As the world continues to grapple with soaring energy costs, supply chain issues and existential climate change problems, all eyes are on the renewable energy sector that continues to gain traction amid increasing demand and long-term growth catalysts. And it seems significant progress is being made in the industry. In 2022, for the first time in history, renewable energy investments were equal to global investments in fossil fuels, according to a report from BloombergNEF. Annual investment in renewable energy, electrified transport and heat, energy storage related technologies totaled $1.1 trillion in the period. The Bloomberg report said that investments in wind, solar and electric vehicles accounted for the biggest chunk of this huge growth. The Russian invasion of Ukraine and its effects on the energy markets hastened the green energy revolution, at least in Europe. A report from IEA says that wind and solar PV have the potential to cut the EU’s reliance on Russian energy by 2023. The report said that annual renewable capacity additions broke a new record in 2021, increasing 6% to almost 295 GW. Supply-chain woes faced by almost every industry in 2022 also affected the renewable energy sector. The IEA report said that solar PV and wind costs were expected to remain higher in 2022 and 2023 due to freight and commodity costs.\\xa0 However, record prices of natural gas and oil continue to make solar and wind energy prices look attractive on a comparative basis. Another long-term growth catalyst for the solar energy sector is the Inflation Reduction Act, which includes huge tax credits for the solar and wind industry.

MSCI\\'s index for EM equities fell 1.2% at 1454 GMT, hitting its lowest since early January. Minutes from the Fed\\'s latest meeting due at 1900 GMT could offer further clarity on the central bank\\'s future monetary tightening plans at a time when data pointing to surprising strength in major global economies has spurred fears of interest rates staying higher for longer. \"Markets are nervous about the Fed, but policymakers ultimately face limits. Despite Chair (Jerome) Powell\\'s uncompromising rhetoric, the Fed has already pivoted to smaller hikes and the next pivot to stopping the rate hikes will be more consequential for markets,\" said Andres Abadia, chief Latin American economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. Meanwhile, Latin American stocks and currencies were muted against the dollar. Oil exporter Mexico\\'s peso which has been one of the strongest performing currencies in the Latam region this year rose 0.5% against the greenback despite lower crude prices. Inflation data from the country as well as minutes from the Bank of Mexico\\'s February monetary policy meeting when it raised rates by a greater-than-expected 50 basis points are due on Thursday. \"We (and markets) are awaiting Mexican inflation data tomorrow as well as Banxico’s February meeting minutes before considering further gains in the MXN,\" wrote Juan Manuel Herrera, senior economist at Scotiabank in a note.
